      Adam was born in Canada and had been seeing films ever since he was a
      child. At the age of 13, he figured out his sexuality, and was so ashamed
      of it that he resolved to take his own life if anyone found out, but later
      he accepted himself.As a child he was part of the boy scouts.He also
      admitted to struggling with addictions of pills and cocaine for two years
      before sobering up, and struggling to tell people about his sexuality and
      interest in the furry fandom before telling his close friends/bandmates.
      While he currently lives in Vancouver, he used to live in Edmonton. Adam
      has stated that he wishes to move to Korea because he likes Korean films,
      and his favorite Korean directors are Chan-wook Park and and Joon-ho Bong.

        Due to his reviews of Cool Cat Saves The Kids, Adam is mentioned in
        almost every commentary/review video of the movie. It is universally
        agreed that if it wasn't for his review, no one would know about the
        film. He also has been acknowledged by the film's director, Derek
        Savage, on many occassions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adam is credited with popularizing many "bad" films (such as Megan is
        Missing, Fateful Findings and Cyberbully) and pushing certain quotes
        from them to memetic mutation status. Even his own Twitter handle is a
        reference to a quote from the film Cyberbully.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adam ends most YMS commentaries with "We're all gonna die, Synecdoche".
        When he doesn't, commenters often point this out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Due to Alex's tendency to rate films lowly and be highly critical,
        whenever he praises a film, commenters would often comment things like
        "why don't you marry it?".
      </li>
      <li>
        Usually when he reacts to Dhar Mann videos, he and his chat often joke
        about Dhar's past criminal record.
      </li>
      <li>
        His favorite Dhar Mann actor is Katherine Norland, who he calls
        "heterochromia lady"
